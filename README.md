Over the past few weeks, I've been diving deep into Ola's ride data for July 2024, using SQL and Power BI to uncover trends and insights. The goal? To analyze booking patterns, driver performance, and revenue metrics—all while improving operational efficiency.

Some key takeaways:
103,024 total bookings processed with ₹35M in total revenue.
Peak hours (6 PM–9 PM) accounted for the highest demand, requiring better driver allocation strategies.
Unveiled top-performing vehicle types and payment methods, with fascinating insights into customer behavior.
Highlighted areas for improvement, like reducing cancellations (which comprised 28% of bookings).

I’ve compiled my findings into dashboards, showing booking statuses, ride volume trends, and even high-value customers! It’s been a rewarding process, not just in technical execution but in the storytelling aspect—presenting raw data in a meaningful way to guide decision-making.
This project reinforced my love for data analytics and the power of combining tools like SQL and Power BI to make impactful observations.
